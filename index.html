			<h3>CyPhyHouse</h3>
			<p>Distributed robotic systems are at the frontier of research in manufacturing, transportation, logistics, and exploration. Yet, managing and experimenting with distributed robotic platforms can be a laborious and error-prone undertaking. Deploying a new algorithm on an existing hardware platform can take weeks; porting an application to a new platform can take months.</p>
			<p>CyPhyHouse provides application programming interfaces (APIs) and an easy to use software environment which reduces the above efforts by orders of magnitude. This new infrastructure provides easy to use, open source, software and hardware platform for rapidly programming, simulating, deploying, and visualizing a rich family of applications on heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. </p>
			<p> The aim of this project is to enable large-scale experimental research needed for developing computing systems that support and rely on coordinated and controlled mobility, for example, in the study of mobility of WiFi access points, debuggers for mobile systems, and augmented-reality with real and virtual Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles</p>
